Comparison and Conclusions:

Accuracy of the Monte Carlo Method: The results obtained using the Monte Carlo simulation are very close to the theoretical values. Differences are fractions of a percent, indicating high accuracy of the simulation.


Practical Application: The Monte Carlo method is very useful in situations where analytical calculations are too complex or impossible to perform. As shown in this example, Monte Carlo can provide results very close to theoretical values.


Recommendations: To achieve even greater accuracy, the number of simulations can be increased. For extremely large numbers of trials (e.g., a billion), Monte Carlo results can virtually match the theoretical values.


Conclusions:

The Monte Carlo simulation is an effective tool for modeling complex random systems. Comparing the simulation results with analytical calculations confirms that with a sufficiently large number of trials, this method provides results very close to the true theoretical values.
